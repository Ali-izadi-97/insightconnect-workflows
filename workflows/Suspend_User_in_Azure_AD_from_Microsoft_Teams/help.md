## Setup

Once the workflow has been imported, edit the workflow and setup or select your Microsoft Teams connection in the _Suspend User Teams Trigger_ 
step. In addition, edit the _Suspend User Account_ step with your correct Azure AD connection information.

Each Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated as well (edit the input with the preset text of `change_me`).

To run the workflow, in the channel you are monitoring enter the following:
`!suspend_user <user_email>`. 

The workflow will reply when it has completed.
