# Description

Reset a user's Azure AD password with a command in Slack. Quickly respond, whether it be to an emerging threat or to another user that locked themselves out of their account.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect reset-password user@example.com`

# Key Features

* **Break the Kill Chain** - Credentials provide attackers with easy access to numerous targets. Disabling a compromised account or forcing a password reset can quickly and effectively interrupt an attackerâ€™s kill chain.
* **Buy Time to Investigate and Remediate** - In a pinch, disabling a user account can limit your threat exposure and buy your team valuable time to investigate and contain a threat. Disabling the user may not remediate the root cause, but it can mitigate the immediate risk while you work on fixing underlying issues.
* **Minimize Disruption to the User** - Forcing a user to reset their password is a small inconvenience compared to re-imaging their entire system. Acting fast can save valuable time and teach a valuable lesson without a noticeable impact to your business.
