# Description

IDR provides built-in machine learning based detections of spearphishing attempts through DNS queries to spoofed domains. On alert generation, this workflow automatically deletes true positive phishing emails across all user inboxes, and also immediately creates a block domain transport rule in Office365 Security & Compliance Center.

# Key Features

* Tag owned domains in IDR
* Alert on DNS queries to spoofed domains and create an investigation to track related alerts
* Prompt the user in Slack to either remediate or close the investigation
* Automatically delete the email across all user inboxes based on a custom search query
