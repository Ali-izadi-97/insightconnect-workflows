description: This workflow is designed to notify Github Pull Request Review Events to Slack.  Post messages directly into your Slack workspace in your preferred channels, private groups, or IM channels.
             When this event occurs, Github will POST a body of information about the Pull Request Review to InsightConnect which will use that information to kick off the workflow and post a message in a Slack channel that a pull
             request review happened. This workflow allows the team to be easily notified when code is ready for review.
